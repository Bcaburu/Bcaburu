# Hi, I'm Bruno Araujo 👋

I work with **Web Analytics and Data Analytics**, focusing on transforming user behavior and business data into actionable insights.

I have a background in Business Administration (FEA-USP) and a postgraduate degree in Big Data and Marketing Intelligence (ESPM).  
Throughout my career I have worked in digital agencies and large e-commerce companies such as Leroy Merlin, and I have also worked remotely for an international fintech, collaborating with cross-functional and global teams.

My professional experience combines marketing analytics and business intelligence. I work with KPI definition, user funnel analysis, conversion rate optimization (CRO), acquisition channel performance, and integration between business stakeholders and technical teams.
